# Moyasar iOS SDK

The Moyasar iOS SDK provides a streamlined way to integrate Moyasar's payment solutions into your iOS applications. With support for CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager (SPM), and manual integration, developers have flexibility in how they incorporate the SDK into their projects.

## Installation

You can integrate the Moyasar SDK into your project using one of the following methods:

### 1. CocoaPods

1. Add the following line to your `Podfile`:
    ```ruby
    pod 'MoyasarSdk', git: 'https://github.com/moyasar/moyasar-ios-pod.git'
    ```
2. Install the dependency:
    ```sh
    pod install
    ```

### 2. Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Swift Package Manager (SPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Starting from version 1.0.5, the Moyasar SDK supports integration via SPM. Hereâ€™s how you can add it to your project:

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to the project settings.
2. Select your target, then go to the "Package Dependencies" tab.
3. Click the "+" button to add a new package.
4. In the package repository URL field, enter:
    ```
    https://github.com/moyasar/moyasar-ios-sdk.git
    ```
5. Choose the branch `master`.
